# pi-aprox-battle
i compared 11 languages in pi approximation just for fun
## building and comparing
## dependencies: gcc, g++, java, node, rustc, python, zig, dotnet, time, [hcc](https://github.com/Jamesbarford/holyc-lang)
comparing:
```bash
chmod +x battle.sh
./battle.sh
```
the output will be produced into ``results/results.txt`` (don't mind that hcc exits with 1, ive no idea lol)
